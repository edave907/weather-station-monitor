● Based on my research, the closest USGS Geomagnetic Observatory to Palmer, Alaska is:

  College Observatory (CMO) - Fairbanks

  Coordinates: 64°51.4'N, 147°50.2'WDistance from Palmer: ~240 miles northeastElevation: 200 meters

  Distance Comparison:

  | Observatory     | Location         | Distance from Palmer |
  |-----------------|------------------|----------------------|
  | College (CMO)   | Fairbanks        | ~240 miles (closest) |
  | Sitka (SIT)     | Southeast Alaska | ~350 miles           |
  | Deadhorse (DED) | Prudhoe Bay      | ~500+ miles          |

  For Your USGS Comparison:

  You should use observatory code CMO (College) for the most geographically relevant comparison:

  # Import data from closest observatory
  python usgs_magnetic_importer.py --observatory CMO --hours 24

  # Compare with local data  
  python magnetic_flux_comparison_plotter.py --observatory CMO --hours 12 --plots all

  Why College Observatory:

  - Closest geographically to Palmer
  - Similar latitude (both in south-central Alaska region)
  - Active USGS station with real-time data
  - Established research facility (operational since 1901, current site since 1940)

  The College Observatory is operated by the University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute in partnership with USGS,
  making it an excellent reference point for validating your Palmer-area magnetic field measurements.

  This should give you much more relevant comparison data than Boulder, Colorado (BOU) which is over 2000 miles away!
